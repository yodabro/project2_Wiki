Hello  Everyone!

![]('http://www.mytinyphone.com/uploads/users/nony17/491796.gif')

We have gathered here to create a Wiki Appa, to get all our knowledge of html/css/JS/node.js/node modules/MongoDB and Mongoose, we will be using jQuery too.

Basic functionality of adding,reading, updating,deleting and editing of the articles created in Our Wiki Appa.

First project thats consist of multiple elements and files that all needs to be working together in order to give the user best experience using the beautiful app.

User's while adding the articles will leave a timestamps of adding and if there is and updates they can be easily implemented into the article and the timestamp of the update will be also shown.

In nearest future Dimi's Team planning to implement :
----------------  >>> user logins(!!! yeah we all  would have our own profiles)
----------------  >>> secured (!!!) passwords
----------------  >>> support of the old version of the article if they've been modified
----------------  >>> comments and comments upon and on changes that has been done to the article
----------------  >>> some fancy styling ninja-assassin-pirate-viking-netherrealm-codename47-adamjensen stuff!!!

Join the fun, stay in touch, we are in NYC till we move to CA! ;)
